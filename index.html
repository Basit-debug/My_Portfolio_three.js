        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          As a Software Engineer, I focus majorly on the frontend of
          applications. I love building accessible applications on the web. I
          also love learning and simplifying tech--coding, practices, tools--via
        </p>
        <p>
          technical articles, videos, and every means possible. My training and
          experience in the field of computer programming and web design along
          with my ability to create robust, high-speed web and mobile apps have
          helped grow revenues, accelerate customer acquisition and deliver a
          competitive advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am open to all tech stacks but I‚Äôm skilled in building high-quality,
          scalable and reusable components with a leading JavaScript library -
          React JS. I am also experienced with the back-end use of Node JS,
          Express JS, MongoDB and Mongoose, the complete MERN Stack to provide
          RESTful API.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am presently undergoing my Master‚Äôs degree in Computer Science at
          Uppsala University. Currently, I am also working as Teaching Assistant
          at Uppsala University.

          <h4>E-Commerce App</h4>
          <p>
            Built an enterprise grade MERN stack app and hosted on Heroku. I
            built the frontend and backend with Firebase, React, Redux, Node,
            Express, custom API, GraphQL and Stripe.

            <h4>Social Network App</h4>
            <p>
              Built an in depth full-stack social network application using

            <p>
              React-Redux based App to track tasks and issues in an IT
              department. JSON Server was used in the back-end and
              materialize-CSS for some cool modals and Toasts in the UI. Its a
              nice full stack MERN application using React, context hooks,
              Redux, actions, reducers.

              Full stack MERN application with a custom Express backend API that
              uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication. I did my API testing
              with Postman and then created a nice flux pattern in the front-end
              by using hooks and the Context API along with the useReducer hook
              and the useContext hooks
